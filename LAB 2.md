### Explanation of `ls | grep '[0-9]' | xargs wc -lwm`

```bash
1. grep -l "MIT" *

    grep searches for the string "MIT" in all files (*).
    -l (lowercase "L") makes grep list only the names of the files that contain "MIT", without showing the matching lines.

2. while read file; do ... done

    This creates a loop where each filename found by grep is read into the variable file and processed one by one.

3. echo "File: $file"

    Prints the filename that is currently being processed.

4. sed 's/MIT/Manipal Institute of Technology/g' "$file"

    sed (Stream Editor) is used to replace occurrences of "MIT" with "Manipal Institute of Technology" in the file.
    's/MIT/Manipal Institute of Technology/g'
        s/.../.../g â†’ Substitute "MIT" with "Manipal Institute of Technology" globally (g) across all occurrences in the file.

```


### Explanation of `kill $(pgrep wc)`

```bash
    pgrep wc
        # pgrep searches for processes by name.
        # It looks for processes with the name wc (word count command).
        # It returns the process IDs (PIDs) of all running wc processes.

    $(pgrep wc)
        # The $(...) syntax captures the output of pgrep wc (i.e., the list of PIDs).
        # This means kill will receive the PIDs of all wc processes.

    kill $(pgrep wc)
        # The kill command sends a termination signal (default: SIGTERM, signal 15) to all the wc processes.

```
